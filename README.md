## Summary 

- The drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know exact parameter to use for the filtering. For example we don't know what dates are available for search. 

- The button to clear all filters will be helpful for new search

- The lists including all available dates/cities/states/countries/ shapes  will be helpful for new serch.
